# Calculator Web Application #

This project is a simple and visually appealing calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.

## Task ## 


The task is to initialize a basic JavaScript application without using any libraries or frameworks. Create a Webpack configuration for this application to enable optimized code execution. The Webpack configuration should optimize the code so that the build output consists of only two files: HTML and JS, regardless of the number of files used during development.

- A modern web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge).

### Steps ###
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karpovvicz/calculator_task0.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
   - You can do this by double-clicking on the `index.html` file or by serving the project using a local development server such as Live Server.

That's it! The calculator will be ready to use.

## Folder Structure ##

The project has the following structure:

```
calculator/
|-- index.html         # The main HTML file for the application.
